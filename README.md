# Network Simulation and Analysis with Packet Tracer and Wireshark

## 🧠 Overview
This project provides a comprehensive study of core network protocols (DHCP, DNS, ICMP) through:
- Packet sniffing and analysis using **Wireshark**.
- Full network simulation using **Cisco Packet Tracer**.
- Routing with OSPF, automated addressing with DHCP, and DNS/web server setup.
- Verification via `ping` and `tracert`.
  

## 📦 Tools & Technologies
- Cisco Packet Tracer.
- Wireshark.
- ICMP, DNS, DHCP, OSPF. 
- Subnetting / IP Planning. 


## 🔍 `wireshark_analysis/`
- Captured and annotated DHCP, DNS, and ICMP packets.
- Key field explanations.

## 🖧 `packet_tracer_network/`
- Multi-router network with 5 subnets.
- One subnet uses DHCP.
- DNS and Web servers configured.
- IP addressing based on university ID.


## ✨ Key Features
- Wireshark captures of service protocols with field analysis.  
- OSPF configuration to route across 4 routers.  
- DHCP lease assignments and testing.  
- DNS record creation and resolution.  
- Custom subnetting based on student ID (e.g., 205.0.6.0/27).  
- Tracert commands showing packet paths.  
- Web access via hostname (e.g., www.ourweb.com).

## 🔍 Subnetting Example
Example using ID: `1200650` → Network: `205.0.6.0/27`  
Includes 6 subnets with ranges and broadcast addresses

## 🌐 Demo
- Accessed web server from PC0 and PC3 using hostname.
- DNS resolution worked as expected.
- Ping and tracert confirmed full reachability.
